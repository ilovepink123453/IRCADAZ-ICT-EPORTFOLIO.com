<h2 style="font-family:fantasy;color:hotpink"> REFLECTION FOR FIRST QTR </h2>
<p style ="font-family:trebuchet ms;color:white"> My first quarter in ICT was difficult. I really had a hard time understanding ICT and coding. But I have friends that help me go through all of these difficulties. I’m grateful to have a teacher like Ms. Uminga who is understanding and good at teaching. She’s funny and caring. I thank my friends, Gab, Rodilyn, Angel, Raven, Raina, and Jolynne. I thank them for supporting me and helping me whenever I need help. This quarter was difficult but I enjoyed the journey!  </h3>
